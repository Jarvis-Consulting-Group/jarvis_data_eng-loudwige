# Introduction
<p align="justify"> The Java Grep app is a powerful tool that can recursively search for a specific text pattern within a directory and save matched lines to a file. It is built using various technologies such as Core Java, Maven, Regex, Lambda, and Stream APIs. Additionally, the app has been containerized using Docker for more efficient deployment and management. Overall, this app provides an excellent solution for users who need to search data quickly and accurately. </p>

# Quick Start

To use the app, follow this format:
</br></br> **Usage: regex rootPath outFile**
- regex: A specific text string that describes the pattern to search for.
- rootPath: The path to the root directory to begin the search from.
- outFile: The name of the output file to which matched lines will be saved.

**To run the application, follow these steps:**
#### Approach 1: Downloading The App and run the JAR file
1. Install Java and Maven on your computer
2. Clone the GitHub repository containing the source code for the application
3. Navigate to the **grep** directory within the repository.
4. Build the application by running the following command: </br>
   ```mvn clean package```
   </br> This command will create a JAR file named "grep-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar" in the "target" directory.
5. To search for a pattern, run the following command: </br>
   ``` java -jar target/grep-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar <regex> <rootPath> <outFile>```
   </br> **_Replace regex, rootPath, and outFile with the appropriate values for your search._**
6. Verify the results by running: </br>
   ```cat out/outFile```
#### Approach 2: Using Docker Image
1. Run the grep app using the Docker image </br>
```
docker run --rm \ 
-v $PWD/data:/data -v $PWD/out:/out jrvs/grep \
<regex> <rootPath> <outFile> 
```
2. Verify the output: </br>
```
cat out/outFile
```
# Implementation
```
matchedLines = []
for file in listFilesRecursively(rootDir)
  for line in readLines(file)
      if containsPattern(line)
        matchedLines.add(line)
writeToFile(matchedLines)
```
# Performance issue
<p align="justify"> The current implementation of the grep app loads all data from the root directory 
recursively in memory, which can cause the application to fail with an 
"OutOfMemoryError" if it runs out of heap space. To prevent this issue, we can increase the heap 
memory size allocated to the application or implement streaming to reduce memory usage. </p>

# Test
<p align="justify">The application has been thoroughly tested using a combination of manual test 
cases and automated testing with JUnit. Sample data was prepared to ensure the application is able 
to handle various inputs and edge cases. The results were then compared to 
expected outcomes to ensure accuracy. All methods were tested and passed successfully.</p>

# Deployment
The deployment involved the following steps:
1. Create a Dockerfile in the application directory with commands to build the image.
2. Package the application using Maven.
3. Build a new Docker image locally using the Docker build command and tag it with Docker Hub
   username and the application name: `docker build` and `-t` option.
4. Verify the image using `docker image ls` command.
5. Push the docker image to Docker Hub using `docker push`.

# Improvements
- Add command-line options to enable case-insensitive search and regex search would provide users
  with more flexibility and functionality.
- Improve performance on large datasets by implementing the use of multiple threads.
