I have a bachelor's degree in computer science and spent two years in a master's program doing research in software requirements engineering. My experience in the field includes two internships where I learned about desktop application development using Core Java, two web applications in Ruby using Agile methodology, service-oriented architecture, and service security. In my spare time, I work on personal projects using Spring Boot. I am currently part of the Jarvis Software Development Program as a Junior Software Developer, working on several applications allowing me to hone my skills in the most sought-after technologies in the software development industry. Outside of school and work, I enjoy sharing my knowledge. In 2017, I volunteered as the coordinator of an IT project where I created a learning program to help children gain computer science skills. In 2021, I was a teaching assistant in a C++ data structures and algorithms class."
