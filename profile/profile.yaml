summary: As a software developer with a bachelor's degree in computer science and experience in software requirements engineering research,  I have gained valuable insight into the development of secure and scalable applications. My professional background includes two internships in software development using Core Java and two web applications in Ruby, where I utilized Agile methodology, service-oriented architecture, and service security to ensure optimal performance. In my free time, I enjoy working on personal projects, particularly in Spring Boot. Currently, I am a Junior Software Developer in the Jarvis Software Development Program, where I am expanding my expertise in various in-demand software technologies. Outside of work, I have a passion for volunteering and have served as an IT project coordinator to help children gain computer science skills and as a teaching assistant in a C++ data structures and algorithms course in 2021.

    description: Developed and implemented a cluster monitoring agent that reduced downtime and improved resource planning for the Jarvis Linux Cluster Administration (LCA) team. Utilized Linux command lines, Bash scripts, PostgreSQL, Docker, and IDEs to collect hardware specifications and monitor real-time node resource usage for a 10-node CentOS 7 Linux cluster. Stored the data in an RDBMS, enabling the team to generate accurate reports and identify future resource needs. Enabled users to analyze data using SQL queries, like the memory usage in percentage over a one-minute interval for each node.
